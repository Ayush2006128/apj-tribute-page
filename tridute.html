        About the Legend
      </h1>

      <p>
        ☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
        was born on October 15, 1931, in
        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
        ☛ He served as the 11th President
        of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
        ☛ Kalam earned a degree in
        aeronautical engineering from the
        Madras Institute of Technology and in
        1958 joined the Defence Research and
        Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
        ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian
        Space Research Organisation, where he
        was project director of the SLV-III, the
        first satellite launch vehicle that was
        both designed and produced in India.
        <br><br> ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
        Kalam planned the program that produced
        a number of successful missiles, which
        helped earn him the nickname <strong>
          “Missile Man.”</strong>
        <br><br> ☛ Among those successes
        was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
        ballistic missile, which incorporated
        aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
        in 1989.
        <br><br> ☛ He also played a
        pivotal organisational, technical,
        and political role in India's Pokhran-II
        nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
        the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
        <br><br> ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
        was scientific adviser to the defense
        minister, and he later served as principal
        scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
        government with the rank of cabinet minister.
        <br><br> ☛ His prominent role in
        the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
        solidified India as a nuclear power and
        established Kalam as a national hero,
        although the tests caused great concern
        in the international community.
        <br><br> ☛ In 1998 Kalam put
        forward a countrywide plan called
        Technology Vision 2020, which he described
        as a road map for transforming India from
        a less-developed to a developed society
        in 20 years. The plan called for, among
        other measures, increasing agricultural
        productivity, emphasizing technology as
        a vehicle for economic growth, and
        widening access to health care and
        education.
        <br><br> ☛ Kalam received <b>7</b>
        honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
        universities. The Government of India
        honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
          in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
          in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
        DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
        to the Government.
        <br><br> ☛ In 1997, Kalam received
        India's highest civilian honour, the
        Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
        the scientific research and modernisation
        of defence technology in India.
        <br><br> ☛ In 2013, he was the
        recipient of the Von Braun Award from
        the National Space Society "to recognize
        excellence in the management and leadership
        of a space-related project".
        <br><br> ☛ While delivering a
        lecture at the Indian Institute of
        Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
        died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
        <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
        <br><br> ☛ Wheeler Island, a
        national missile test site in Odisha, was
        renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
        2015.
        <br><br> ☛ A prominent road in
        New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb
        Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
        in August 2015.
        <br><br> ☛ In February 2018,
        scientists from the Botanical Survey
        of India named a newly found plant
        species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
        honour.
